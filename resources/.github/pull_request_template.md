## Visual Aid

## Additional Information <Delete unnecessary points>

### How Has This Been Tested?

I tested this manually

### Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If so, why isnâ€™t this functionality reused?

Yes, Redux is exists in this codebase. I implement this because it's good for fast fetching and sending API requests.
